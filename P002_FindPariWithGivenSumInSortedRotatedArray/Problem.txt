Problem:
Given an array that is sorted and then rotated around an unknown point.
Find if the array has a pair with a given sum ‘x’.
It may be assumed that all elements in the array are distinct.

Eg.
Input   : arr[] = {11, 15, 6, 8, 9, 10}, x = 16
Output  : [6,10]

Input   : arr[] = {11, 15, 26, 38, 9, 10}, x = 45
Output  : []
