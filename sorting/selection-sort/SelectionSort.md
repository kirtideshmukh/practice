##Selection Sort
* In-place sorting algorithm
* Works well for smaller files
* Called *selection sort* since it repeatedly *selects* the smallest element

###Algorithm
1. Find minimum value in the array
2. Swap it with the value in the current position
3. Repeat this process for all elements until entire array is sorted

###Complexity
* Best    : O(n^2) time | O(1) space
* Average : O(n^2) time | O(1) space
* Worst   : O(n^2) time | O(1) space
###Advantages:
* Easy to implement
* In-place sort (does not require any additional storage space)
###Disadvantages:
* Does not scale well : O(n^2)
